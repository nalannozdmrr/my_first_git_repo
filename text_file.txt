do not delete this file 
This file is important

Day 1
-----
STEP 1: Create a project on intellij
file>new project
Name : my_github_project
-------------------------
STEP 2: Create github repository
*Repository(git repo) means github project folders. We must create a repository to store projectc
*We already installed git.
-------------------------
****STEPS FOR CREATING A REPOSITORY****
repository
***. https://github.com/ and login
***. click on your profile
***. Click on your repository
***. Click on New
***. repository name : my-first-git-repo
***. select public or private then create
-------------------------
STEP 3: Push the first code to github
*Open intellij terminal
*Then follow the instruction on github!!!
     *git init :Done by only ones for each project.This is used for initializing
      the project. This will create .git folder to store the project versions!!!

NOTE: If you see: The term 'git' is not recognized it means github installiation
      is not complete. Then get in touch with tech support

     *git add . :Done after each code changes.

     *git commit -m "first commit" :Done after each code changes.
     This is used for creating new versions of the project

     *git branch -M :Done once for each project

     *git remote add origin httpa://github.com/nalannozdmrr/my-first-git-repo.git
     :Done once for each project

     *git push -u origin main :Done once for each project

***If your code is successfully pushed, then you should refresh your github and
see your code in github
***If your see error read the error message
DONE**************

*****GIT PUSH PRACTICE*****
After the first push, we do not use some of the git comments that we used in the first commit.

1.Create a new java class under src: FirstJavaClass
2.Create a main methıd and write code :
public class FirstJavaClass{
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       System.out.println("Learning github");
   }
}
3.Then push this code to the same repository

     *git add .
     *git commit -m "second commit"
     *git push

*******************************************************

HOW TO PULL THE CODE FROM GITHUB TO LOCAL COMPUTER
*Create a new file: text_file.txt
*Add some comments: do not delete this file
                    This file is important
*Commit new file
***Now we created a file in github

We will get that code from github to intellij.
In intellij terminal write below commend to pull the code
   *git pull

***USEFULL COMMENDS:

git status : This is our friend
We see the status of our codes
We can use this anytime to see where your are

Day02*******
***REVİEW OF GIT PUSH:
    *git add .
    *git commit -m "second commit"
    *git push

***REVİEW ABOUT GIT PULL:
    *git pull
Create a new class RemoteJavaClass.java under src folder in github
*Create new file
*Type below code in that file
public class RemoteJavaClass {
   //This will also have some java code
}
*Scroll down and click commit new fie
*git pull
Then your github code should be in your local repo

***How to push ONLY ONE SPECIFIC file?

    *git add "path of the file"
    *git commit -m "message"
    *git push
Example:
Create a new java class: ForthJavaClass
Create another java class: FifthJavaClass
Create a new commit to push only ForthJavaClass
Create another commit to push only FifthJavaClass

*git add "src/ForthJavaClass.java"
*git commit -m "message"
*git push
----
This code should push only src/ForthJavaClass.java
